# Schedule-Planner
A replacement for PASS.
INCOMPLETE

run with the following command: "python3 main.py <inFile> <numClasses>"
both of the parameters are optional

for now, it has basic functionality, and runs with no errors.
still need to add:
	- days of the week, and thus a much more complicated time scheme
	- a method of putting in classes as either/or - this could be accomplished by simply limiting the output to the number of classes one wishes to take
	- add output file functionality
	- format the results in a way that is conducive to schedule planning
		- you can choose a class or classes to be imperative, meaning that only schedules containing that class can be displayed
